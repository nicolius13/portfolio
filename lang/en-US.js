    "I used to work as a lab technologist in the pharmaceutical industry. When I moved to Senegal I took this opportunity to make a career change. I've always been passionate about IT and the web world and therefore decided to self-train in web development at first. After I moved to Laos I followed the ‘Front-end Developer’ Certified Training on OpenClassroom to pursue my goal, to work in web development. I'm now looking for new projects!",
